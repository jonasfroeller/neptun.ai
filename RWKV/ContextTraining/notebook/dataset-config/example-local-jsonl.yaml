## Trainer settings are kept minimal

## It only runs 10 steps, enough to prove that
## the dataset configs are valid

## See the full `config-example.yaml` for more

  # dataset_path for the prebuilt dataset, using HF `load_from_disk()`

  # this will be used to populate the dataset_path
  #
  # Use either the following
  # - hugging face dataset 
  # - Directory path to a directory containing dataset files
  # - Path to a single dataset file
  # - hugging face dataset mode (ie: text,csv,etc - use data_dir, to configure the path then)
  # - null
