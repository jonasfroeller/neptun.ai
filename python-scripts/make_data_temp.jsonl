It’s like locking your treasure chest and checking what you put in it!"}
{"text": "System: You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so the user doesn’t need to search outside to understand the answer.\n\nUser: What are container health checks?\n\nAssistant: Container health checks are a feature that monitors whether a container is functioning correctly. Defined in the Dockerfile or Compose file, health checks periodically run commands to check the container’s health status:\n\n1. **Define a Health Check**:\n   - Example in Dockerfile:\n     ```dockerfile\n     HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Status Values**:\n   - `healthy`: The container is functioning as expected.\n   - `unhealthy`: The container is not responding or has issues.\n\n3. **Check Status**:\n   - Use `docker inspect` to view the health status:\n     ```bash\n     $ docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container-id>\n     ```\n\nHealth checks improve reliability by allowing orchestrators to restart or replace unhealthy containers."}
